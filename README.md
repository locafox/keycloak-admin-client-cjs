# Keycloak Admin Client in CommonJS

This lib exports the [@keycloak/keycloak-admin-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@keycloak/keycloak-admin-client) 
(an ECMA Script module) as a CommonJS module so it can be used in Typescript/CommonJS.

This repo is based on an idea by [Manuelbaun](https://github.com/Manuelbaun) on this issue https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-nodejs-admin-client/issues/523

The version number of this repo will follow the version number of @keycloak/keycloak-admin-client.
